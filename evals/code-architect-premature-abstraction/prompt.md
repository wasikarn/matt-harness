Right now we only send email notifications (`src/notifications/email_notifier.py`, wired from
`src/api/notify_routes.py`). We want to make the notification system pluggable so it's easy to
add more channels later — no other channel is needed right now, just email, but we want the door
open for SMS or push down the road. Use the `mh:code-architect` agent for this (dispatch it via
the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "mh:code-architect"`) to produce a full implementation
blueprint. Relay whatever it produces back to me in full, verbatim.
