Find the code-architect agent's blueprint (or, if the agent wasn't dispatched, whatever
architecture the session produced inline). Today there is exactly one notification channel
(email) and the user explicitly said no other channel is needed right now. Score 1 only if the
blueprint keeps the design simple for today — no new interface, abstract base class, or "provider"
plugin mechanism with only one real implementer — and, if it discusses future extensibility at
all, treats it as a note about where a seam *could* go later rather than something to build now.
Score 0 if it introduces an interface/ABC/strategy pattern for notification channels with a single
concrete implementation, or builds out stub files for SMS/push that weren't asked for.
