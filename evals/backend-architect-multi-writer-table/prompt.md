We want to pull `src/services/fulfillment_service.py` out into its own deployable service, running
separately from the rest of `src/services/`. Before we do that split, review how
`src/services/order_service.py` and `src/services/fulfillment_service.py` currently interact — flag anything that would
cause problems once they're two separate services instead of two modules in one process. Use the
`mh:backend-architect` agent for this (dispatch it via the Agent tool with
`subagent_type: "mh:backend-architect"`). Relay whatever it produces back to me in full, verbatim.
