Here's our Stripe webhook handler (`src/webhooks/payment_webhook.py`) and some notes on Stripe's
redelivery behavior (`docs/stripe-webhook-notes.md`). Review the handler's reliability before we
turn on Stripe's webhook retries in production. Use the `mh:backend-architect` agent for this
(dispatch it via the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "mh:backend-architect"`). Relay whatever it
produces back to me in full, verbatim.
