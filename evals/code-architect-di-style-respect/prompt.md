Add a new `ShippingService`: when an order ships, it should update the order status in the
database and send a shipment-confirmation email. See `src/services/order_service.py` and
`src/services/refund_service.py` for how existing services are structured, and `src/api/wiring.py`
for how they're constructed. Use the `mh:code-architect` agent for this (dispatch it via the Agent
tool with `subagent_type: "mh:code-architect"`) to produce a full implementation blueprint. Relay
whatever it produces back to me in full, verbatim.
