I want to add a `MonthlySummaryReportGenerator` that compiles monthly stats and emails them to a
distribution list — basically the same shape as `src/reports/legacy_report_generator.py`, just a
different report. Use the `mh:code-architect` agent for this (dispatch it via the Agent tool with
`subagent_type: "mh:code-architect"`) to produce a full implementation blueprint: files to
create/modify, the interfaces, the build order. Relay whatever it produces back to me in full,
verbatim.
