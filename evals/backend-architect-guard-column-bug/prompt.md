We're about to turn on multiple worker instances for `src/billing/charge_worker.py` so we can
process the charge queue faster. Before we do, review it for correctness under concurrent workers
— this handles real customer payments, so a double-charge would be bad. Use the
`mh:backend-architect` agent for this (dispatch it via the Agent tool with
`subagent_type: "mh:backend-architect"`). Relay whatever it produces back to me in full, verbatim.
