# Stop: commit any dirty changes in the current project's memory store to its
# own git history. Restores a real audit trail / rollback path for the
# memory store, which previously had zero version control — see
# docs/research/agent-memory-engineering-2026-08-07.md proposal A4 (verified
# 2026-08-07: `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` failed against the live
# store, confirmed, not assumed).
#
# Fires on Stop (per-turn, not once-per-session) — deliberately more
# frequent than a true "session boundary". `git add`+`commit` is cheap and a
# no-op when the tree is clean, so the extra granularity is a feature (finer
# rollback resolution), not a cost worth avoiding. Mirrors
# hooks/stop/cost-tracker.sh's own async:true wiring so a slow or failing
# git call never blocks turn completion.
#
# Requires the memory dir to ALREADY be a git repo (one-time, user-run
# `git init`) — this hook never runs `git init` itself. Initializing version
# control on a directory outside this repo is a decision the user makes
# once, not something a Stop hook does silently on their real data.
#
# Cross-session locking (2026-09-28, worktree-per-session support): the
# memory store is now reachable identically from every worktree of a repo
# (scripts/_lib/memory-dir.py), so two sessions ending at the same instant
# race for real -- `.git/index.lock` contention, or one session's marker
# overwritten by another's. Serialized via an atomic mkdir lock directory
# (portable; `flock` is not reliably available on macOS). See ACQUIRE_LOCK
# below for the full protocol and its rationale.
