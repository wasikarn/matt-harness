# gap for an interactive session, the same shape as Phase B's `gh pr merge` ask-tier
# rule in irrecoverable.py. It does not, and cannot, constrain a Routine that already
# exists and is running outside this Claude Code session -- see the ADR's §4 for why.
# An unrecognized/missing action fails toward asking, not allowing: the cost of an
# extra confirmation is low, the cost of silently allowing a future mutating action
# this gate doesn't yet know about is not.
