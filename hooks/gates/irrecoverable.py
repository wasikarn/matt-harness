# mentions do not trip it; the flag scan is quote-aware so a separator inside a
# quoted prompt does not end it early. re.MULTILINE: a line inside an
# interpreter-fed heredoc body is its own statement.
# GH #152: `claude\b` alone matched mid-token (a path like /tmp/claude-501/...
# contains a word-bounded "claude", since "-" is a non-word char), and the
# forward flag scan did not stop at a newline, so a later unrelated line's
# flag (e.g. `mkdir -p`) got attributed to that false match. Fixed by
# requiring "claude" to end the token -- next char must not be an
# identifier/path-continuation char (word char, "-", ".", "/") -- and by
# treating an unquoted newline as a scan-stopping separator, same as &/;/|.
# A code-review round on the first attempt caught two dangerous-direction
# regressions before ship, both since covered by tests below: (1) an
# allowlist-shaped exclusion (only \s;&|) rejected legitimate shell
# metacharacters too, e.g. missing `claude>out.log -p x`; a denylist of
# continuation chars is the correct shape. (2) a bare newline-stops-scan rule
# also stopped at a backslash-continued newline (`claude \` + real newline +
# `-p`), which is still ONE shell statement -- the scan now treats a
# `\`-then-newline pair as non-breaking, matching how a real shell (and this
# file's own _newlines_to_seps, used elsewhere) treats line continuations.
# ponytail: only single-backslash continuation is tracked, not escape parity
# (`\\` + newline, an even count, is NOT a continuation in real bash but is
# treated as one here) -- habit-guard, not adversarial sandbox, same posture
# as this file's other documented one-level-only unwraps.
# ponytail: `cat <<EOF | bash` bodies are stripped as inert and not scanned,
# add heredoc-body scanning if a nested-spawn bypass via heredoc is ever demonstrated.
#
# 2026-09-20 audit: a prefix wrapper (env/command/sudo/nice/nohup/time, singly
# or chained -- "env sudo claude -p x") sat between the anchor and "claude"
# with nothing to match it, so the anchor never fired and the deny below
# never ran -- live-confirmed. A bare `\claude` (backslash suppresses alias
# lookup in real bash; the command itself is unaffected) had the same gap.
#
# Fix: an allowance matched against this file's own PREFIX_WRAPPERS word list
# (below), not a generic "any token" skip -- a generic skip was tried first
# and reverted: it made this anchor match `claude` wherever it next appeared,
# including deep inside an unrelated command's quoted argument (broke the
# existing `git commit -m "mention claude -p in docs"` -> ALLOW regression
# test in tests/hooks/test-gates.sh, since this anchor runs on the raw
# command text, not the quote-masked string subagent-git-guard.py's sibling
# anchor uses). Matching only real wrapper WORDS keeps that same precision:
# "git", "commit", "-m", or a quoted-string token never satisfy the
# alternation, so an anchor attempt from string-start still requires
# "claude" immediately, exactly as before this fix.
#
# 2026-09-20 fix-round 2 (compliance-audit vs the plan above): bounding both
# axes at 3 was itself a deviation from the plan's `*`-repeated design and
# left a real gap -- an independent verifier chained 13 wrappers and got
# past the depth<=3 cap live. The catastrophic-backtracking risk that
# motivated the bound is real for a naive `(?:(?:sudo|env)\s+(?:\S+\s+)*)*`
# (a wrapper word also matches the inner generic token, so the two `*`s
# compete for the same input and multiply out) -- but the fix for that is to
# remove the ambiguity, not cap the length. The inner flag-scan below
# excludes anything that matches a wrapper word via a negative lookahead, so
# any given token is always unambiguously "the next wrapper" or "a flag",
# never a choice between the two. That makes the whole prefix scan O(n) with
# no backtracking blowup, so both axes go back to genuinely unbounded,
# matching the plan ("env -u X FOO=bar sudo nice -n 10 command env claude -p x"
# now anchors regardless of chain length).
# Wrappers whose own flags may take a space-separated value before the wrapped
# command (an attached value, "-c3" / "-oL" / "--signal=KILL", is one token and
# needs no case). timeout/gtimeout also take one DURATION positional; that is
# handled where the wrapper is unwrapped. setsid takes bare flags only; exec's
# `-a name` is the one value flag (GH #227: it hid the wrapped command).
# Open-ended by nature: a wrapper missing here (watch, flock, strace, ...) still
# hides its command, the list covers the ones an everyday one-liner uses.

    # opener, but got miscounted as depth+=1, swallowing the real ";" and
    # crediting othertool's -p back to claude. (2) a first, simpler fix
    # (fixed-length "\\X" pairing, no parity check) then ALLOWED `claude
    # \\`printf x; printf y` -p evil` -- an EVEN (double) backslash before a
    # backtick leaves the backtick unescaped and live in real bash (the pair
    # is just one literal backslash), so it really does open a command
    # substitution carrying -p back to claude; treating the backtick as
    # escaped there was a false ALLOW, a real bypass, not just an

# span vanishes in real bash once its output splices in ("gi`true`t" IS "git"),

# dispatch. Resolving the substitution would mean running a subshell, so instead
# the span is blanked to one placeholder byte (PH): PH is a shlex wordchar so it
# fuses into the surrounding text as ONE token, and any argv0/subcommand token
# still containing PH is duplicate-classified across every KNOWN_DANGEROUS /
# KNOWN_GIT_SUBS candidate downstream.
# Closer-search depth-counts same-type brackets so nested spans ("$(echo
# $(date))", "$(f() { :; }; f)") resolve in one pass; the fixed-point loop stays
# as defense-in-depth. Out of scope: a bracket hidden behind a quote/escape
# boundary INSIDE the span (quotes tracked at top level only).
# Each downstream flag comparison strips PH itself (full .replace, not a
# leading-only strip: a mid-flag PH like --for<PH>ce is an exact-match bypass).
# Blanking must not DISCARD the body ("$ (git push --force)" is a real deny), so
# every backtick/$(...)/<(...)/>(...) body is re-appended as its own statement;
# ${...} bodies are not (parameter expansion, not a command). Single-quoted
# spans are never blanked; double-quoted $(...) IS live in bash -- telling them
# apart needs the real quote-state scan below, not a regex. A span inside a "#"
# comment passes through unchanged. <(...)/>(...) (GH #181) is never a real
# "<"/">" redirect -- a redirect target can't start with an unescaped "(" -- so
# blanking it here, before _blank_redirections runs, also stops that "<"/">"
# from being misread as a redirect operator downstream.
PH = "\x01"
# shlex.shlex's own `commenters` (never overridden, stays its default "#") skips
# to the next real "\n" the moment it sees an unquoted "#" ANYWHERE in a token,
# mid-word or not -- it has no word-position awareness, so a literal "foo#bar"
# fed to it unchanged still loses everything from "#" onward, regardless of the
# in_comment tracking below (that tracking only keeps quote-state correct while
# copying comment text through -- see "A span inside a "#" comment passes
# through unchanged" above -- it does not change what shlex itself treats as a
# comment start). A mid-word "#" is swapped for this placeholder before shlex
# ever sees it (a genuine word-boundary "#" is left alone, so shlex's own
# comment-stripping still runs for a real comment); HASH_LIT is added to
# lex.wordchars at both call sites. No downstream restore to "#" is needed: no
# dangerous argv0/flag/subcommand this file matches on contains "#", so a
# placeholder byte counts as one nonflag token exactly like a real "#" would.
HASH_LIT = "\x02"
# A process-substitution span ("<(cmd)"/">(cmd)", GH #181) blanks to ITS OWN
# placeholder, never bare PH: unlike "$(...)"/backtick, whose expanded value
# IS attacker-controlled to be an arbitrary string (so PH must be fully
# .replace()d back out before any exact flag/subcommand match, everywhere PH
# already is), a process substitution ALWAYS expands to a bash-synthesized
# "/dev/fd/<n>" path -- it can never literally become "-f"/"--force"/"rm"/etc,
# so PSUB never needs that same defensive stripping. The one place PSUB DOES
# matter: a PURE PSUB token (`git checkout main <(true)`) is a real nonflag
# argument to checkout, but not a real worktree pathspec checkout could
# overwrite (a "/dev/fd/<n>" target), so it is excluded from checkout's

# nonflag-arg count or exact-token check (e.g. checkout's "1 nonflag = branch
# switch, 2+ = tree-ish+path") must not see it. A prior attempt fixed this by
# stripping matching tokens AFTER shlex(posix=True) tokenized the command --
# rejected (2026-09-29, found by an adversarial Codex pass, see
# security-gate-token-strip-needs-quote-state memory): posix=True dequotes, so
# a LITERAL quoted ">" and a real unquoted > redirect become the identical
# token string, and stripping "a bare digit immediately before an operator
# token" can't tell a real fd-prefix ("2>&1", no space) from a real positional
# arg that happens to be a digit followed by a separately-spaced redirect
# ("checkout HEAD 2 >out" -- shlex has already discarded whether that space
# existed). Both are only resolvable from the RAW string, where quoting and
# spacing are both still intact -- so this runs BEFORE shlex, on the raw
# command text, with real quote/comment state tracked char-by-char exactly
# like _newlines_to_seps above (same escape-pair and quote-toggle rules), never
# treating a quoted or backslash-escaped character as a real operator. Matched
# spans are DELETED outright, not blanked to PH: PH would make a token vanish
# from the "compacted" window copy below but still count in the RAW copy (PH
# is a wordchar, so it's still one non-flag token there) -- and "a deny in
# either copy wins" means the raw copy's inflated nonflag count would still
# false-deny, exactly the bug this exists to fix. A redirect target is never
# itself a command to re-scan for danger (unlike a $(...) body), so nothing
# needs to survive at that position the way a substitution's body does.
# Runs AFTER _blank_substitutions so a redirect character inside a $(...) body
# that gets re-appended as its own statement is still correctly re-scanned
# (it's real command text by then), and one already blanked to PH is not
# double-processed (PH itself never matches the redirect-operator regex).
# "#" is NOT in this set: bash only treats "#" as a comment-starter at the
# START of a word, not glued mid-word ("out#suffix" is one literal filename) --
# handled as a special case in the target loop below (round 2, found by an
# adversarial Codex pass: `git checkout HEAD >out#suffix <realfile>` let the
# target-consumption stop at "#", silently dropping <realfile> from the scan
# entirely; that exact payload correctly denies on the unmodified gate).
# "{"/"}" are ALSO not in this set, for the same reason, found the same way
# (round 3): unlike "(" and ")" -- real, always-special shell operators, a bare
# unquoted "{"/"}" mid-word is just a literal character in bash (verified live:
# `bash -n -c 'echo out{suffix'` is a syntax error for "(" but NOT for "{" --
# only paired, comma/range-shaped brace expansion is special, and only at a
# word boundary). `git checkout HEAD >out{suffix <realfile>` bypassed the same
# way the "#" case did before this line excluded them too.
# GH #188: bash 4+'s named-fd form "{var}>file" is a redirect too. Its "{var}"
# prefix used to survive as text: the outer tokenizer split it into "{" "var"
# "}" (window breaks), cutting `checkout HEAD {fd}>/dev/null <path>` off before
# <path> (fail-open), and the bash -c/eval tokenizer (whitespace_split) kept
# "{fd}" as one nonflag arg (over-deny on a plain branch switch). Only matched
# at a word start (checked at the call site): "x{fd}>f" is the literal word
# "x{fd}" followed by a plain ">f" redirect. Like an fd number, "{var}" never
# prefixes "&>"/"&>>" ("{fd}&>x" is the word "{fd}" plus a redirect). ">|"
# (noclobber) and "<>" are operators too: without ">|", "{fd}>|x <path>" left
# "|x <path>" as a pipe that cut the window before <path> (#208 validator).
