# gate:agent:subagent-verdict-check -- Tier 1 of the "auto-apply the attacker
# pattern via hooks?" design note (docs/research/
# nine-agent-gate-architecture-security-audit-2026-09-20.md, "Design note"
# section). A SubagentStop hook that mechanically catches a vacuous or
# self-contradictory Rule 13 verdict object -- {"pass":true,"findings":[],
# "scope_ok":true,"unexpected_files":[]} is schema-valid but shows no
# verification work, the exact gap `checked[]` closes in prose (spawn-brief.md,
# METHODOLOGY.md) and in the 3 sibling skills' own check-verdict.py scripts.
# This makes the same rule apply automatically to every OTHER Rule 13 dispatch,
# which today has no check-verdict.py-equivalent at all (confirmed 2026-09-20:
# zero file-based consumers parse the generic contract programmatically).
#
# Stateless by design (no cross-call bookkeeping): the loop bound is the
# `stop_hook_active` field Claude Code already puts on the payload for
# exactly this loop-prevention purpose, read below, not a counter kept here --
# adding one would be the exact session-scoped-round-counter shape #135/#137
# already rejected.
#
# Fail-open posture matches this repo's other subagent-scoped gates
# (subagent-git-guard, subagent-spawn-guard, task-complete-separation): the
# "verdict" here only optimizes a check that would not otherwise run at all,
# it never authorizes an irrecoverable action, so any internal failure must
# fall through to the native no-hook-installed behavior (let the subagent
# stop), never block. Per operating-model.md's stated principle: "fail open
# to the native/no-op path when the verdict only optimizes one that was
# already going to happen anyway."

    # 2026-09-21 deep-audit: the old per-"{" rescan was O(n x braces) -- 30,000
    # leading "{" before a vacuous verdict took ~15s, past the 8s SubagentStop
    # timeout, so the block was silently dropped. Now one pass per start
    # keeps a stack of open positions and pops a candidate span on each "}",
    # marking every "{" it pushed as visited; a later pass only starts at a
    # "{" that every earlier pass saw inside a string (fresh, not-in-string
    # state there, exactly what the old per-"{" rescan did). Same spans found,
    # ordinary input is one pass. `work` is charged once per char walked,
    # shared across passes and never reset (same pattern as irrecoverable.py's
    # _SPAWN_SCAN_BUDGET); on exhaustion raise so the caller takes this
    # gate's documented fail-open path fast. Validator catch, same day: a
    # first cut also charged each popped span's full length, so 1500 NESTED
    # braces cost N(N+1) and hit the budget -- a cheaper bypass than the one
    # being closed. json.loads is the only remaining super-linear cost, so a
    # span whose own nesting is deeper than _MAX_SPAN_DEPTH is never handed
    # to it (a real verdict is ~3 deep; json.loads would RecursionError near
    # 1000 anyway). `depths` mirrors `stack`: the deepest level seen inside
