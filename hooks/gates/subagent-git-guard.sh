# Gate: a subagent (agent_id in the PreToolUse payload) may not run a bare
# `git stash|reset|clean` -- repo-wide mutation on a tree the parent session
# (and any other subagent sharing it) is still working in (issue #135;
# 2026-09-28: worktree-per-session means this is now the parent session's own
# worktree rather than a tree shared with unrelated peer sessions, but a
# subagent still shares that ONE tree with its parent and siblings, so the
# same repo-wide-mutation risk applies). Main session (no agent_id) is
# untouched; `claude --agent` main
# sessions also lack agent_id, so agent_type is NOT the discriminant.
# irrecoverable.sh already denies the destructive forms (reset --hard, clean -f,
# checkout --, restore <path>) for every session; this gate only adds the three
# non-force verbs, for subagents. Coarse pattern match, not a sandbox: a quoted
# "git" is read (GH #344), but a second parse level (eval of an escaped quote)
# or a substitution that builds the word "git" is a non-goal, and a
# heredoc BODY line starting with "git stash" over-blocks (no heredoc parsing).
#
# Fast path (GH #326) skips python3 only on proof it would allow in silence. A bare "no agent_id
# substring" check is a bypass (GH #154: the key can be written with a \u escape). JSON's other
# escapes (\" \\ \/ \b \f \n \r \t) cannot make a letter or "_", so with neither agent_id nor \u
# in the raw text, a payload that also matches the plain-object regex below (ASCII, depth 2, no
# arrays) parses to a dict with no agent_id key: python exits 0, no output. Anything else runs
# python3 (malformed JSON keeps its stderr line). Keep `_input=$(cat)` on line 33: bash's NUL-byte
# warning names it. No "no git substring" shortcut: g\it serializes as g\\it (GH #317).
