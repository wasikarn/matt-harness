# 2026-09-20 audit: the old wrapper allowance (`sudo`/`xargs` only, one level)

# `xargs` kept from the original list (this file never runs its own
# xargs-unwrap, so the anchor must still recognize it).

# 2026-09-20 fix-round 2 (compliance-audit): a first attempt bounded both
# chain depth and flags-per-wrapper at 3 to dodge the catastrophic-
# backtracking shape of `(?:(?:sudo|env|...)\s+(?:\S+\s+)*)*` (a wrapper word
# also matches the inner generic token, so the two `*`s compete for the same
# input) -- but that bound was itself a live-demonstrated gap (a 13-wrapper
# chain got through). The actual fix is to remove the ambiguity instead: the
# inner flag-scan excludes anything matching a wrapper word via a negative
# lookahead, so a token is always unambiguously "the next wrapper" or "a
