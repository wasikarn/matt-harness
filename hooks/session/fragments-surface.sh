# fragments-surface.sh — SessionStart: surface a one-line pointer per
# writing-fragments document this project has an unseen on-disk change for.
# Registered twice in hooks/hooks.json against this one script: plain
# (matcher startup|resume|clear, id session:fragments-surface) filters by
# snapshot-diff and records what it shows; --reinject (matcher compact, id
# session:fragments-reinject) skips that filter entirely and reprints every
# on-record document unconditionally, never recording -- the opposite
# inclusion the former session:handoff-surface had (removed v1.1.94), since a fragments file is a
# living artifact whose one stated path is exactly the kind of thing
# compaction loses. Advisory only; content is never inlined, only a path
# pointer and a change-detection snapshot. Full design and every round-N
# finding this script encodes: docs/adr/0003-writing-fragments-pointer-capture.md.
#
# Never reads stdin (the posture the former handoff-surface.sh had, removed v1.1.94, for the same
# run-gauntlet backgrounded-test-runner stdin-inheritance hang risk).
