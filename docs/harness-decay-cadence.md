# Harness Decay Cadence (build-to-delete)

A human-run review cadence that keeps this harness minimal as the models it
compensates for improve. Most components — a skill, an agent, a hook, an
always-on `additionalContext` block — exist to work around a *model limitation*
of the day. When the model gets better, some of those workarounds become dead
weight that still costs tokens and attention. This cadence names the practice of
finding and retiring them.

It **documents an existing practice**; it adds **no new machinery** and **no
auto-prune**. Both the measure and the delete decision are human-gated.

## The lens: every component compensates for an assumed model limitation

For each component, the load-bearing question is: *what model limitation does
this compensate for?* Record that assumption. Examples:

- a `clarify-first` gate compensates for "the model guesses instead of asking";
- a verbose doctrine block compensates for "the model forgets the convention";
- a maker≠checker reviewer agent does **not** compensate for a limitation — see
  the guard below.

When a model upgrade lands, the assumption behind a workaround may no longer
hold. That is the trigger to re-measure.

## Cadence

1. **Surface candidates** — run the audits that already exist; add no new tool:
   - `harness-audit` (`skills/harness-audit/scripts/audit.sh <root>`) for fleet
     health and dead / unloadable components;
   - `inventory` (`skills/inventory`) + a `BOUNDARY.md` drift snapshot it can
     emit and you commit — to catch a component that silently appeared or vanished;
   - the periodic `.scratch/skills-decay-audit-<date>/` sweeps (decommission
     candidate lists);
   - `workspace-surface-audit` (the owner's global capability-audit skill) as the
     **inverse lens**: it answers "what can the workspace/platform do *now*," and
     when the platform gains a capability a component used to polyfill, that
     component becomes decay-eligible. (Its own job is setup/capability auditing,
     not decay detection — use its output as context, not as a decay detector.)
2. **Disable-and-measure** — disable a candidate (hook profile off, or remove
   the always-on block) and run the work it was meant to catch. If quality holds
   without it, the limitation it compensated for is gone.
3. **Delete with a witness** — if the measure says it is dead weight, remove it
   through `decommission`: sign an `ABSENT_*` witness so the orphan (stray
   symlink, cron, launchd job) is caught later, not silently resurrected.
4. **Keep the assumption recorded** — if you keep it, note *why the limitation
   still holds*, so the next upgrade has a baseline to measure against.

This pairs with `recursive-improve` (the add/fix loop): recursive-improve closes
the loop on what to **build**; this cadence closes it on what to **delete**.

## Hard guard (load-bearing): never auto-delete maker≠checker

Decay reasoning must **never** retire a verifier on the argument that "the model
can verify its own work now." The maker≠checker separation exists for
**vouchability and independence** — a fresh-context checker catches what the
maker cannot see — not because the model is too weak to check. That is exactly
the boundary METHODOLOGY Rule 4's fresh-context-verification principle and the
autonomy invariant (`CONTEXT.md` §Invariants) protect. Collapsing the checker into the maker is the
rejected autonomous self-rewriter, not a decay win.

Both the **measure** and the **delete** decision stay human-gated. There is no
auto-prune: a decay finding is a candidate the human reviews, exactly like a
`recursive-improve` candidate. Automate past the point where you can still vouch
for the output and you ship agent slop.
