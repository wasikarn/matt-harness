# codex integration map

`codex@openai-codex` (source `openai/codex-plugin-cc`) paired alongside mh as a second,
independent coding agent — a different model family, routed to by name. Not a wrapper, mirror,
or orchestration layer: mh creates no surface whose only job is to call Codex (see
`CONTEXT.md`'s "pairing" entry). Re-verify this table whenever the installed `codex` plugin
cache version changes; no check parses it. Full reasoning: `docs/plans/codex-pairing-2026-09-06.md`.

## Routing

| skill | invocation | mh touchpoint / fallback |
|---|---|---|
| `/codex:review` | user or model | read-only diff review; Claude-side alternative: `mattpocock-skills:code-review`. On rate-limit or absence, run the Claude-side review instead, invoked by the operator — independence is lost for that pass |
| `/codex:adversarial-review` | user or model | challenges a plan after `mattpocock-skills:grilling`; Claude-side alternative: `mh:plan-reviewer`. Same fallback as review |
| `/codex:rescue` | **user or model** — ships without `disable-model-invocation`, and `codex:codex-rescue` is a full Agent-tool `subagent_type` | writes files through the Codex app-server, not Claude Code tools — see Gate gap below. The review-gate toggle is gated (ADR-0001); the rescue dispatch itself carries no codex-specific gate. From the main session it stays fully ungated; a *subagent* attempting the same dispatch is denied as a side effect of `gate:agent:subagent-spawn-guard` (GH #151), which blocks every subagent-initiated Agent-tool call uniformly and was not built with codex in mind |
| `/codex:setup` | **user or model** — ships without `disable-model-invocation` | the one surface mh puts a real gate on: `gate:skill:codex-setup-guard` asks before a model-invoked call carrying `--enable-review-gate` |
| `/codex:transfer` | user only (`disable-model-invocation: true`) | Claude near its own limit → hands the session to a resumable Codex thread. The reverse of the fallback direction above |
| `/codex:status` | user only | job and review-gate status, read-only |
| `/mh:compliance-audit` (mh's own skill, not a `codex@openai-codex` skill) | user only (`disable-model-invocation: true`) | Phase 2's verifier dispatches a raw `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --cd <worktree> --model <selected-model> -c model_reasoning_effort=<selected-effort> --output-last-message <file> --output-schema <schema-file>` (explicit flags; scoped to a disposable pinned worktree — not read-only, since it reruns the gauntlet) as primary, for stronger maker≠checker separation than a fresh Claude context alone; Claude-side alternative: a `general-purpose` subagent. On rate-limit or Codex absence, fall back to the Claude subagent — independence is lost for that pass, same fallback language as `/codex:review` above. Both paths pipe the raw output through `skills/review/compliance-audit/scripts/check-verdict.py` (own schema/ambiguity/`NEEDS-DECISION` handling, mirroring deep-audit's script) before trusting it: exit 0 = one valid verdict with `pass` computed by the script; exit 2 = `NEEDS-DECISION`, surfaced to the operator; exit 1 = malformed/ambiguous, retry the dispatch once before calling it `scope_ok: false` |
| `/mh:deep-audit` (mh's own skill) | user or model (no `disable-model-invocation`) | Step 3's fresh-context checker dispatches `codex exec --sandbox read-only --model <selected-model> -c model_reasoning_effort=<selected-effort>` (explicit flags, not the config-dependent default; no worktree, since the checker never writes and needs the current tree, not a pinned SHA) as primary; Claude-side alternative: an `Explore`/review agent (the pre-existing mechanism). On rate-limit, absence, timeout, auth failure, a schema-invalid result, or a semantic refusal (schema-valid JSON that still didn't do the review), fall back to the Claude agent — independence is lost for that pass, same fallback language as `/codex:review` / `/mh:compliance-audit` above. Unlike those, a failed fallback here doesn't just get noted: it hard-forces the skill's own Final Verdict to `fail` ("verification incomplete"), since deep-audit's rubric would otherwise let a checker-less run still pass on its other dimensions |
| `/mh:idea-audit` (mh's own skill; **not currently shipped** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s skills list deliberately excludes `skills/workflow/idea-audit/`, a documented row for the code that exists and is tested, not a claim it ships) | user or model (no `disable-model-invocation`) | Phase 2's attacker dispatches `codex exec --sandbox read-only --model <selected-model> -c model_reasoning_effort=<selected-effort> --cd <repo-root> --output-last-message <file> --output-schema <schema-file>` (same shape as `/mh:deep-audit`'s checker — read-only, no worktree) as primary; Claude-side alternative: a `general-purpose` subagent whose brief says "you write nothing" (the Agent tool has no per-invocation `disallowedTools` — that's an agent-file frontmatter field only — so the real backstop is `git status --porcelain` before and after the dispatch; never `mh:plan-reviewer`, which hard-stops on non-plan input) — independence is lost for that pass, same fallback language as the rows above. Fallback triggers are the same six as `/mh:deep-audit`'s. On all-fallback failure, or every finding failing a post-parse citation-shape check, the adversarial criterion is marked `insufficient evidence` and Phase 3 blocks on the operator, rather than the deep-audit-style hard-fail override — idea-audit's rubric has no "insufficient evidence left out of the total" path to close |

The three bare `codex exec` dispatches — `/mh:compliance-audit`'s verifier, `/mh:deep-audit`'s
checker, `/mh:idea-audit`'s attacker — are the ones `docs/reference/spawn-brief.md`'s effort-flag
note above refers to; `checks/72-codex-effort-set-drift.sh` only parses the first
`--effort <a|b|c>`-pattern line in `spawn-brief.md`, unaffected by any of the three.

Both `/mh:deep-audit`'s checker and `/mh:idea-audit`'s attacker are read-only and never write, so
the "Silent-refusal gotcha" section's empty-diff detection method below doesn't apply to either —
that method assumes a writer whose refusal shows up as "nothing changed" on disk. Their refusal
signal is a schema-invalid or semantically-refusing final message instead, caught per the rows
above.

## Gate gap

`/codex:rescue` edits files through the Codex app-server, not through Claude Code's tool-call
pipeline — none of mh's other gates (`gate:bash:irrecoverable`, `gate:bash:subagent-git-guard`,
`gate:task:complete-separation`, `gate:write:test-integrity`, `gate:write:config-guard`) see
those writes. **This repo's own git hooks (`git-hooks/pre-commit`, `pre-push`) are the
vendor-agnostic floor**: whatever wrote a file, the same lint, harness-audit, and gauntlet run
before it ships, regardless of which agent produced it. ADR-0001 records why no codex-specific
gate picks up the rescue dispatch as a rider on this trial. `gate:agent:subagent-spawn-guard`
(GH #151, shipped after ADR-0001) denies it anyway when a *subagent* is the caller, but only
as an instance of its blanket "no subagent dispatches Agent" rule — it never inspects
`subagent_type`, so it is not the codex-specific gate ADR-0001 declined to build. Main-session
dispatch of `/codex:rescue` (the normal path) is unaffected.

Sandbox/approval note: no `~/.codex/config.toml` recommendation is needed for this pairing.
The plugin hardcodes its own sandbox per call — `read-only` for `/codex:review` and
`/codex:adversarial-review`, `workspace-write` (never `danger-full-access`) for rescue's write
path — as a structured parameter to its app-server, not a config file setting. `config.toml`
can still supply model/effort defaults when the plugin leaves those unset; the explicit
sandbox supplied by the plugin takes precedence for its calls.

## Model, effort, and account cost

Choose model and effort before each dispatch, using the signed-in account rather than a
bundled default. On 2026-09-14, Codex CLI 0.154.0 reported ChatGPT Plus, no purchased credits,
and access to Luna, Terra, Sol, and Astra through `model/list`. This is a dated observation,
not a required plan or a live balance. Recheck `account/rateLimits/read` through the app-server
(or `/status` in the CLI) when planning substantial work; never commit account IDs or tokens.

Codex has no automatic model router: the model is whatever `--model`, `-c model=`, a profile or
`config.toml` names, else the bundled default. Its only automatic behaviour is `ultra` effort
delegating to subagents (this plugin rejects `ultra`), Plan mode's built-in effort preset when
`plan_mode_reasoning_effort` is unset, spawned agents defaulting to
`agents.default_subagent_model`/`agents.default_subagent_reasoning_effort`, and migration or
rate-limit prompts that ask before switching.

**Slugs re-verified 2026-09-26** against this account's own catalog (`codex debug models`, CLI
0.156.1): `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-6-luna`, `gpt-6-astra` and `gpt-5.6-terra` are listed, and
`gpt-5.6-sol`/`gpt-5.6-luna` are still listed, so the GPT-6 rollout for Sol and Luna is not a
hard break. `gpt-5.5` carries an upgrade to `gpt-5.6-sol` and retires 2026-10-14. Terra has no
GPT-6 variant yet. Credit rates (public docs, 2026-09-23): `gpt-6-sol` and `gpt-6-luna` cost
roughly half the prior rate on input and cached-input tokens (exactly half for Sol on every
column; Luna's output-token rate is cut further, to ~0.42x — see the exact numbers below).
Re-verify this note the next time this table is touched.

| Work | Starting model | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Clear, small edits or extraction | `gpt-6-luna` | `low` |
| Bounded implementation or verification of explicit requirements | `gpt-5.6-terra` | `medium` |
| Ambiguous bugs, adversarial review, cross-file judgment | `gpt-6-sol` | `medium` |
| Hard end-to-end investigation with sustained judgment | `gpt-6-astra` | `medium` |

OpenAI's own starting points are Sol `medium`, Luna `high` and Astra `low`
(`learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models`). By operator policy, this table starts Luna lower (small, clear
tasks) and Astra higher (the hardest tasks).

These are starting choices, not measured quality guarantees. Deep-audit and idea-audit normally
start with Sol/medium; compliance-audit starts with Terra/medium for explicit requirements,
Sol/medium if interpretation is material. Increase to `high` for a concrete unresolved reasoning
problem; reserve `xhigh` for unusually hard cases. Keep the same evidence and acceptance checks
at every tier. If quota cannot support adequate verification, report it incomplete or use the
existing independent-checker fallback; never call a weaker or skipped check a pass.

Validate the chosen slug and effort against the live catalog; if unavailable, choose an
available model suitable for the same task and disclose the substitution. No silent retry loop
or automatic paid fallback. Never hardcode a personal `-p` profile in shipped commands: profiles
are machine-local. On bare CLI dispatches substitute `--model <selected-model>` and
`-c model_reasoning_effort=<selected-effort>`; the existing sandbox, cwd, schema, and fallback
contracts still apply. Global config is only the default when a call does not override it.

For `/codex:rescue`, use `--model` and `--effort` as runtime flags under this operator-authorized
routing policy, not prose hidden in the task. The installed plugin 1.0.6 task path forwards both;
its review/adversarial-review paths do not forward a task effort flag. Do not promise those
review commands honor `--effort`; use their supported controls and report the actual selection.
The plugin accepts up to `xhigh`, not `max`/`ultra`.

Plus consumes included usage before purchased credits; API dollar rates are not the account's
invoice. Published credit rates per 1M input/cached-input/output tokens, fetched live from
`learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pricing` 2026-09-23: `gpt-6-luna` 2.5/0.25/12.5, `gpt-5.6-terra`
50/5/300, `gpt-6-sol` 50/5/250, `gpt-6-astra` 250/25/1250. The superseded `gpt-5.6-sol` and
`gpt-5.6-luna` rates (100/10/500 and 5/0.5/30, unchanged since 2026-09-14) still apply if a
dispatch falls back to either during the rollout. These compare credit usage; they do not price
included quota or prove actual spend. Recheck current pricing when the account, plan, or catalog
changes. Avoid optional fast/priority service and speculative fan-out as cost defaults; neither
is required by this policy.

## AGENTS.md

Codex reads `AGENTS.md`, not `CLAUDE.md`. Drop this paragraph into a repo pairing Codex with
mh:

> This repo runs under `mh@wasikarn` (Claude Code). Its full doctrine is `CLAUDE.md` +
> `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`; the parts that bind you too: (1) the decision-sizing triad before any
> non-trivial change — one-way door? blast radius? riskiest assumption? — (2) a requirement is
> a claim to test, not a truth to obey: name what's ambiguous, missing, or assumed before
> touching code, (3) a bug fix starts with a failing test, the test passing is done. mh's
> `gate:*` PreToolUse hooks are Claude Code hooks — you are not under them; this repo's git
> hooks (`git-hooks/pre-commit`, `pre-push`) are the floor that applies to every edit
> regardless of which agent made it.

No generator, no sync script — short enough to hand-keep in sync with `CLAUDE.md`'s own map.

## Silent-refusal gotcha

Every Codex thread loads `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (or `AGENTS.override.md`) unconditionally, before
any project `AGENTS.md`, with no config switch — `codex exec`, the TUI, and the app-server path
this plugin's `/codex:rescue` uses alike (codex-rs `codex-home/src/instructions/mod.rs`,
`core/src/agents_md_manager.rs`, checked against codex-cli 0.153.4). A user-level rule written for
one project (a pinned model/effort, a mandated orchestration flow) therefore governs every rescue
on the machine, and Codex declines correctly but quietly: **clean exit, empty diff, polite
refusal in the final message**. Two defences, both borrowed from `DannyMac180/fable-advisor`
(observed live 2026-08-04): (1) treat an empty diff after a clean run as `refused`, never
`complete` — the companion script does not check this, so the dispatcher does: compare
`git status --porcelain` before and after a `--write` rescue, and read the returned message as
a refusal when nothing moved; (2) open the task text with a one-line opt-out scoped to this run
("this task runs deliberately on the model and effort named in the invocation; treat it as an
explicit opt-out from any instruction-file default flow; every other rule still applies"). The
empty-diff check is the one that actually catches it; the preamble only avoids it.

Evidence status (2026-09-06, codex-cli 0.153.4, `gpt-5.4-mini`): reproduced locally, both halves.
A throwaway `CODEX_HOME` whose `AGENTS.md` mandates an "orchestrator flow", one append-a-line
task: without the preamble, **exit 0, `git status --porcelain` empty, final message a polite
refusal** ("this workspace requires the orchestrator flow ... you didn't opt out"); with the
preamble, exit 0 and the file changed. Quota-exhausted and provider-without-access runs, by
contrast, exit 1 with `ERROR:` on stderr: those fail loudly, only the refusal is silent.

## Degrading gracefully

Every line above still has to make sense with the plugin absent, the Codex CLI missing, or the
operator logged out: the routing table just names an unavailable fallback path (the "on
rate-limit or absence" column), the gate no-ops if `Skill(codex:setup)` is never called, and
check 71 (`skills/meta/harness-audit/scripts/checks/71-codex-review-gate-state.sh`) reports
INFO "not installed" rather than erroring.
