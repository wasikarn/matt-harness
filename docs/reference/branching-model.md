# Branching model

`develop` is protected (2026-09-28, Phase B of the SDLC-playbook reversal): no direct push, PR
required. Work on a `feat/<slug>` or `claude/<slug>` branch, `gh pr create` against `develop`,
review via the already-installed `mattpocock-skills:code-review` (verified installed:
`skills/engineering/code-review` in the `mattpocock-skills` plugin cache) — this repo does not
rebuild that flow as its own skill (composer-not-creator,
`docs/reference/composer-not-creator.md`). Merge method: merge-commit or rebase, never squash —
a squashed feature branch is not merged by ancestry, so only `git branch -D` removes it locally
(the gate allowed that only from 2026-09-30, for a plain `git branch -D <names>` without main/master/develop).
`delete_branch_on_merge: true` on the remote handles cleanup.

Enforcement layers, weakest to strongest:
- `git-hooks/pre-push` refuses a direct push whose remote ref is `refs/heads/develop`, before the
  gauntlet even runs — local, defense-in-depth, one manual retry if a stdin ref line is malformed.
- `gate:bash:irrecoverable` asks (not denies — a merge can be a legitimate, operator-approved
  action) on `gh pr merge` / `gh api .../merge` from an interactive Claude Code session. This
  covers only a session running with mh loaded — it does **not** constrain the GitHub web UI, a
  raw API call, or any credential used outside such a session (a cloud Routine, notably —
  `docs/adr/0004-operator-authorized-routine-self-launch.md`, `status: proposed`, is where that
  threat model is actually being worked through; mh has no self-launch path shipped today).
- GitHub branch protection on `develop` (PR required, `enforce_admins`, live-applied 2026-09-28;
  required status checks removed 2026-10-03 along with GitHub Actions) enforces the PR flow only; a single-maintainer repo means
  `required_pull_request_reviews.required_approving_review_count` stays at **0** (GitHub refuses to
  let a PR author approve their own PR, so any higher count would make every PR permanently
  unmergeable with only one account) — merging still requires nothing more than a write-access
  credential. "Review" here is this repo's own operating custom, not something
  branch protection mechanically enforces. An admin editing the protection rule itself is a
  separate, named, accepted residual risk, not something any of the above closes.
  There is no CI (2026-10-03): the pre-commit and pre-push hooks are the only gates, so a clone with
  `core.hooksPath` unset, or a push from another machine, skips them. Re-add a workflow and the
  required contexts together if that stops being acceptable.

## Merging: `scripts/merge-pr.sh <PR>` (GH #450)

#445 and #446 were each green alone and red together on `develop`. Agents merge through
`scripts/merge-pr.sh <PR>`, not bare `gh pr merge`. It runs `git fetch origin`, refuses unless the
PR's base is `develop` (re-read just before the merge) and its head contains the `origin/develop`
tip (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`), waits for load below 4
(default 900s, then fails with the load figure), fetches and re-checks ancestry after that wait,
refuses a head whose versions are not plain `X.Y.Z`, whose two manifests disagree, or whose version is equal to or below
`origin/develop`'s (checked before the wait and again after it; `MERGE_PR_ALLOW_SAME_VERSION=1`
skips only the equal-version refusal, for a PR that needs no bump; an unreadable manifest or a
failed fetch after the wait also refuses, with a message naming it), merges with
`gh pr merge --merge --match-head-commit <checked sha>`, and prints the merge commit sha. On a
behind-develop refusal, rebase on `origin/develop` and push (on a wrong-base refusal, retarget the PR
with `gh pr edit <PR> --base develop`): the pre-push gauntlet then runs on the exact tree that
will merge, and the pinned sha makes GitHub refuse a head that moved after the check.

The checks are local-only. The script narrows the gap; it does not close it: a push to `develop`
from another clone between the check and the merge can still race, and nothing stops a merge made
outside the script. The script's own `gh pr merge` call runs inside the script, so
`gate:bash:irrecoverable`'s ask on that command does not see it.

The former `git worktree add -b` deny predates this and was removed in the v1.0.0 rebuild;
`claude --worktree` and `/branch` never routed through it anyway. `/branch` and
`claude --continue --fork-session` are session branches, not git branches: they fork the
conversation without touching the working tree.

**Never run upstream's `git-guardrails-claude-code` setup here** (`skills/misc/` in
mattpocock/skills, not in the plugin's skills list). It wires a PreToolUse
hook blocking *all* `git push`, not just `--force`. `gate:write:config-guard` asks on exactly
that settings edit shape (any change to `hooks` or `enabledPlugins`), so there is a backstop;
the instruction still stands.

## Concurrent sessions

Each interactive session gets its own working tree (2026-09-28): `EnterWorktree`/`claude
--worktree` creates a linked worktree under `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` (gitignored), torn down
via `ExitWorktree`/`git worktree remove` when the session ends — this replaces the old
one-tree-for-everyone model, which needed manual path-claiming discipline to avoid stepping on a
peer's uncommitted edits. What's still shared across every worktree of this repo, and still needs
discipline:

- **The memory store is one shared directory, not per-worktree.** `scripts/_lib/memory-dir.py`
  resolves the same encoded key from every worktree (keyed off `--git-common-dir`, not
  `--show-toplevel`), so `hooks/stop/memory-audit-commit.sh` serializes its own commit across
  concurrent sessions via an atomic lock — see the script's own header for the lock protocol.
- **A subagent shares its parent session's worktree**, not a worktree of its own — the same
  stage-by-path discipline still applies to it (`gate:bash:subagent-git-guard` denies a bare
  `stash`/`reset`/`clean`; verify `git diff --cached --name-only` before committing). **Opt-in
  exception (2026-09-28):** a builder dispatch that already trips Rule 13's validator requirement
  may instead get its own worktree, merged back only on a clean validator pass —
  `docs/reference/spawn-brief.md`'s "Isolated checkout dispatch" section. Not the default; the
  shared-worktree-plus-discipline model above still applies to every other dispatch.
- **`ListAgents`/`SendMessage` file-claim discipline** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, injected globally)
  still applies to anyone touching a file another live session might also touch — worktree
  isolation removes the *working-tree* collision, not a collision in a file both sessions read
  from or write to outside git (e.g. this repo's own manifests, or the shared memory store above).
- **Re-read both manifests right before writing a version into a commit message.** A peer session
  in a different worktree can still push a bump first; `Read` always sees the latest committed
  state, not what was true when this session started.
- **Bump the manifests last, then re-check at the PR and again right before merging.** Run
  `git fetch` and read `origin/develop`'s version immediately before the bump commit and once the
  PR exists. Right before merging, compare this head's version with `origin/develop`'s first, then
  run `scripts/merge-pr.sh` (never bare `gh pr merge`, see Merging above). If a peer's bump merged
  in between, move to the next number first. Two PRs that cut the same version leave the installed
  cache with whichever tree built first, and the other change does not load until the next bump
  (#492 and #493 both took 1.1.189, #496 and #497 both took 1.1.191, 2026-10-05).
- **`/rewind` only reverts this session's own worktree.** It can no longer touch a peer's tree at
  all, since each session now has its own — this constraint from the old shared-tree model is
  gone, not merely mitigated.
