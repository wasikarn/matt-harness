# Model Router

## Overview

This is the **master routing skill** for all mental models. Instead of knowing 38 frameworks, start here. Identify your domain and problem type, and this skill points you to the right model(s). Think of it as the "which tool do I use?" guide.

**Core Principle:** Don't memorize models—memorize how to find the right one. Domain + Problem Type → Model.

## Short-Circuit: Skip the Router

**If you already know the right model, invoke it directly — don't route.** This skill is for when you're *unsure* which model fits. If the problem obviously calls for a specific model (e.g., "where's the bottleneck?" → theory-of-constraints; "how would an attacker break this?" → red-team), go straight to it. Routing is overhead you only pay when the match isn't obvious. Likewise, if no model clearly helps, just reason directly — don't force one.

## Quick Router

### Step 1: What's Your Domain?

| Domain | You're working on... |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Coding/Debugging** | Bugs, errors, performance issues, root cause |
| **Architecture** | System design, technical decisions, scalability |
| **Product** | Features, user needs, prioritization, roadmap |
| **Business Strategy** | Competition, growth, market, organization |
| **Personal Decisions** | Career, life choices, major commitments |
| **Abstract/Analytical** | Arguments, ideas, theories, pure reasoning |
| **Risk/Safety** | What could go wrong, preparation, resilience |
| **Innovation** | New ideas, breakthroughs, creative solutions |

### Step 2: What's Your Problem Type?

| Type | You need to... |
|------|----------------|
| **Diagnose** | Find root cause, understand why |
| **Decide** | Choose between options |
| **Understand** | Grasp how something works |
| **Create** | Generate new solutions |
| **Evaluate** | Judge quality or validity |
| **Predict** | Forecast outcomes |
| **Optimize** | Improve performance |

|-----------|--------------------| --------|
| High-stakes decision | Sequential | Reversibility → Pre-mortem → Opportunity Cost |
| System diagnosis | Nested | Cynefin (macro) → ToC (meso) → OODA (micro) |
| Validating strategy | Parallel | Red Team + Steel-manning + Second-Order |
| Innovation under constraints | Sequential | First Principles → TRIZ → Effectuation |
| Career decision | Temporal | 5 Whys (past) → Circle of Competence (present) → Regret Min (future) |

# Model Router Analysis

## Context
Domain: [Coding/Architecture/Product/Strategy/Personal/Abstract/Risk/Innovation]
Problem: [Brief description]
Problem Type: [Diagnose/Decide/Understand/Create/Evaluate/Predict/Optimize]

## Routed Models
Primary: [Main model to use]
Secondary: [If needed]
Combination pattern: [Sequential/Parallel/Nested/None]

## Application
[Apply the selected model(s) here]

## Verification
- [ ] Domain correctly identified
- [ ] Problem type matches
- [ ] Model fits the situation
- [ ] Considered if combination needed
```

## Key Questions

- "What domain am I operating in?"
- "What type of problem is this—diagnose, decide, understand, create, or evaluate?"
- "What's the default model for this domain + type?"
- "Does one model cover it, or do I need to combine?"
- "Am I using a model because it fits, or because it's familiar?"

---

**Remember:** You don't need to know all 38 models. You need to know how to find the right one. Start with domain, identify problem type, look it up, apply. That's it.
