"""Validate a dispatched compliance-audit verifier's return value and compute `pass`.

Mirrors mh:deep-audit's scripts/check-verdict.py (same NEEDS-DECISION escape hatch,
same brace-scanning, same ambiguity handling) for compliance-audit's own contract:
references/verifier-output-schema.json. Used on both paths — pipe Codex's
--output-last-message file through this too, not just the Claude-fallback path,
because Codex's --output-schema only guarantees the verifier's JSON matches the
schema; it does not compute `pass`. This script is the only place `pass` is ever
computed: SKILL.md's own rule ("`pass` is never true on requirements alone") is
transcribed here so no hand-eyeballed reconciliation ever reaches the report.

stdin: the verifier's raw final message text (Codex --output-last-message file
contents, or the Claude-fallback agent's final message).

Behavior:
  - A literal `NEEDS-DECISION` anywhere OUTSIDE a parsed JSON span wins over any
    JSON found nearby, same rule as deep-audit's script and for the same reason:
    the contract is a verdict object OR an escalation, never both. mask_json_spans
    masks out JSON first so a match found only inside an otherwise-valid verdict's
    own `note` field isn't mistaken for a real escalation.
  - Scans every '{' in the text and keeps every candidate that fully validates
    against the schema (exact key-set equality) AND the semantic rule below.
    Exactly one valid candidate is required; two or more distinct ones reject as
    ambiguous.
  - `requirements` must be non-empty. An empty list plus a trivially-clean
    gauntlet (e.g. `exit_code: 0` on an empty `command`) would otherwise satisfy
    `compute_pass`'s `all()` vacuously — found by deep-audit 2026-09-19, the
    same vacuous-pass shape idea-audit's `checked[]` already guards against.
  - Semantic rule beyond the JSON Schema: `accepted` must be a bool when
    `verdict == "DEVIATED"` (was it sanctioned or not — null is not an answer for
    a requirement that actually deviated) and must be null otherwise (CONFORMS/
    MISSING don't have an acceptance question to answer).
  - Computes `pass` per SKILL.md Core Principles: every requirement is CONFORMS or
    an accepted DEVIATED, AND gauntlet.exit_code == 0, AND scope_ok is true. A
    verifier-supplied `pass` field is never read — this script is the only
    arithmetic, same reason weighted-score.py is the only place a score total is
    computed.

Exit codes: 0 = exactly one valid verdict (printed to stdout as JSON, with `pass`
added); 1 = malformed, rejected, or ambiguous (reason on stderr, nothing on
stdout — never reaches Phase 3's report); 2 = NEEDS-DECISION escalation.
