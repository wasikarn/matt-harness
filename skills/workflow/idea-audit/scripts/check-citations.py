"""Citation-shape check for idea-audit attacker output.

Found by the 2026-09-19 criteria-quality audit: SKILL.md and attacker-brief.md
both described this as something "the host checks" by eye -- schema validity
alone only proves `evidence` is a non-empty string, not a real citation. This
script makes that check mechanical. Run it AFTER schema/pass/checked-presence
validation (already enforced by --output-schema or a manual parse) -- it does
not re-validate the envelope, only the citation shape inside each `evidence`.

stdin: the attacker's already schema-valid JSON (see attacker-output-schema.json).

A citation shape is: a backticked span `...` (a command), OR a path-like token
(contains "/" or ".") immediately followed by ":<digits>" -- a path:line cite,
or the path:line prefix of a grep -n style "path:line:content" excerpt. The
path-like token must contain at least one letter (harness gap-audit,
2026-09-20): a bare numeric ratio like "2.5:1" also has a "." followed by
":<digits>" and previously false-matched as a citation.

# ponytail: shape only, not substance -- `` `trust me` `` passes this check the
# same as `` `git log --oneline -5` `` does. Verifying the backtick content is
# an actually-runnable command needs either a real shell parse or another LLM
# judgment call, which defeats "deterministic, not eyeballed" for a narrow win
# against a bad-faith attacker (who could game any regex this strict just as
# easily). Deep-audit 2026-09-19 flagged this residual gap explicitly; the
# ceiling is raise-if-abused: if a real run is ever caught citing empty
# backticks, add a minimum-token-count or known-verb check then, not now.

Exit 0: every findings[]/checked[] evidence string has a citation shape --
nothing on stdout, matching the gauntlet's own quiet-on-success convention.
Exit 1: at least one evidence string fails -- each failing item printed to
stderr as "{findings|checked}[i]: <evidence text>". Per SKILL.md, a failing
item is treated the same as a missing citation for Phase 3's scoring, not a
reason to reject the whole attacker run by itself.
