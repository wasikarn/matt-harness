# 70. Stray top-level entries (working-tree clutter Claude Code globs every session)
# Gitignored eval workspaces, graphify caches, and scratch dirs never reach git, so
# nothing in the gauntlet ever saw them — but every Glob/Grep in a session did
# (2026-09-06: 22 `*-workspace/` dirs, ~500 graphify cache files, .scratch/ sitting
# in the tree three months after the rebuild rule said "delete everything else").
# WARN only; the operator trashes or extends the allowlist. Plugin-mode (flat repo)
# only — the dotfiles layout nests the fleet under claude/ and has its own top level.
# .in_use is Claude Code's own LSP-connector lock marker (`.in_use/<pid>`, written only
# while an LSP plugin actually holds the project) -- transient, not clutter, confirmed
# firing and clearing on its own during a live session 2026-09-26.
