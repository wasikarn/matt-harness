# 23. Name format — skills + agents. code.claude.com/docs/en/skills + /sub-agents:
# name = lowercase letters, digits, hyphens only; max 64 chars. A bad name breaks
# discovery/namespacing. Scaffolds (_*) ship placeholder names — skipped. The char
# class below already rejects a bare `:` (reserved for plugin-scoped agent IDs like
# `my-plugin:reviewer`), so that part of sub-agents.md's name rule needs no separate
# check — verified 2026-08-29 against a round-2 audit claim that overlooked this loop
# already covering agents/*.md.
# Reserved-word ban (platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/
# best-practices.md, verified 2026-08-29): name must not contain "anthropic" or
# "claude". No separate XML-tag check is needed here — the char-class regex below
# already excludes XML tags from name; that ban is real for description too, just
# not checked (check 20's own char-limit is a separate, deliberately unresolved gap).
