# (1536-char runtime truncation limit) and check 43 (cumulative listing budget); neither
# of those checks word count or voice. WARN only: a style convention, not a runtime cap.
# "Third person" here means no I/we/you-class pronoun (see PRON_PATTERN below) — a bare
# imperative clause ("Use when …") is NOT a violation; check 05 requires exactly that clause.
# Known false-positive class (mh:deep-audit F4, 2026-09-24, left unfixed — WARN only, no
# live hit today): grep -i makes bare "I" match "i.e."/"I/O"/"us-east-1"/"en-US", and "me"/
# "my" match a quoted first-person trigger phrase like "help me plan". A description that
# needs one of these will false-positive; rewrite around it or accept the WARN.
