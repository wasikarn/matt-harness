# 20. Description length — skills, agents, commands.
# code.claude.com/docs/en/skills + /sub-agents: description max 1536 chars
# (combined with when_to_use). Over-limit is silently truncated by the runtime,
# which can cut off the negation clause and degrade routing. fm_get --block
# returns the full block-scalar body (with indent stripped), so multi-line
# descriptions are measured accurately against the limit.
# Gap, not a live bug (verified 2026-08-29): this only measures `description`.
# Zero surfaces in this repo currently carry a `when_to_use:` field, so nothing
# is undercounted today — but the 1,536-char cap is on the COMBINED
# description+when_to_use text, so a future skill adding when_to_use would need
# this check to sum both fields.

# 20.5. Duplicate-surface detector — two surfaces sharing the SAME name: AND a
# near-identical description are a true content twin (the kbg-help skill+command
# dup, removed v0.2.66). Same name with DISTINCT descriptions is a legitimate
# skill↔command twin (e.g. ideate) — NOT flagged. Keys on name to stay
# false-positive-free; similarity is computed via python difflib on the
# description bodies. Fires on ratio ≥ 0.85 OR a ≥ 60-char identical run (a
# copy-pasted "Don't use for…" tail), which the closest-match-wins-wrong
# routing failure (code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) is born from. WARN, not CRIT:
# an intentional twin pair that drifts into similarity is a routing smell, not a
