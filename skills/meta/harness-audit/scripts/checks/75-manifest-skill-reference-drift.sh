# 75. Manifest skill-reference drift (harness gap-audit M12, 2026-09-20).
# `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills` array is the canonical list of what
# actually ships -- a directory-prefix glob per entry, sometimes a whole
# bucket (`./skills/meta/`), sometimes one specific skill inside a bucket
# (`./skills/workflow/ideate/`, which covers only that one skill). README.md
# and docs/reference/codex-integration-map.md both once presented
# `mh:idea-audit` as shipped while this list excluded it (re-shipped in
# 1.1.132). This makes that cross-check mechanical instead of relying on
# remembering the manifest's exact prefixes by hand.
#
# Scope, deliberately narrow: only flags an `mh:<name>` reference where a
# REAL `skills/**/<name>/SKILL.md` exists on disk right now but isn't
# shipped -- exactly the "documented as shipped but excluded from the
# manifest" class M12 exists for. Two things this deliberately does NOT
# flag, both out of scope here:
#   - `mh:<agent-name>` (backend-architect, plan-reviewer, ...) -- agents are
#     a different manifest section/namespace entirely, not a skills/ dir.
#   - `mh:<retired-skill-name>` (handoff, orchestrate, recursive-improve,
#     ...) -- no skills/ directory exists for these any more; a name with no
#     matching directory is stale-doc drift (a separate, already-planned
#     cleanup item), not a manifest-exclusion mismatch.
# A first, broader version of this check (every `mh:<name>` in prose)
# false-positived on both of the above classes, live-reproduced during
# this check's own authoring — narrowed here rather than hand-tuned with a
# growing exception list.
#
# EXPECTED_EXCLUDED: skills that exist in the repo, are tested, and are
# intentionally documented in prose (not silently deleted) despite not
# shipping -- flagging every mention of these as a fresh "drift" finding
# would just re-punish the correctly-caveated documentation this same audit
# pass wrote. Only reverse an exclusion here if the manifest itself changes;
# see this file's own docs/reference/codex-integration-map.md entries for
# the caveat wording each mention should carry.
