# 3. Agent loadability (plugin cache or ~/.claude/agents symlink). The hooks
# loop that used to live here was a strict subset of check 11 and was dropped
# 2026-09-05 (round-3 review).
# 3b. Symlink integrity — agents.
# Regression guard: 14 agents (and, historically, at least one command — see
# CLAUDE.md) were committed to the repo but never symlinked into ~/.claude/,
# so Claude Code could not load them. No check caught it because symlink
# integrity covered only skills and hooks. (The commands/ loop that used to
# live here was dropped 2026-08-25, #112 — commands/ retired as a surface
# type entirely, every command converted to a skill.)
# CI-safety: same guard shape as check 02/the hooks loop above.
