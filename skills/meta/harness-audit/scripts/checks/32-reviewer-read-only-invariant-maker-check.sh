# reviewer/analyzer (reviewer|analyzer|analyst|hunter|critic|judge|checker|architect),
# OR whose declared `bucket:` frontmatter is review/analysis, must NOT grant
# Write or Edit: a verifier that can mutate what it reviews defeats the fresh-context
# independence maker≠checker depends on. Load-bearing doctrine: CLAUDE.md's Operating
# model paragraph, under its Architecture section (the L3 bounded-autonomy build it
# came from was retired; the maker≠checker rule survives there) — these agents
# run unattended inside the loop's Gate-2 review. The source frontmatter is read-only
# today (fix 5c06590); this is the regression guard against a future re-widening.

# bucket agent named e.g. "dependency-scanner" or "race-detector" would carry a
# Write/Edit grant past this check with a clean audit. OR the bucket-field check
# in (declared role drives the invariant, not just a naming convention); keep
# the name check too, since bucket: is optional (check 04 only WARNs if it's
# missing) and this check must still fire for an agent that omits it.
