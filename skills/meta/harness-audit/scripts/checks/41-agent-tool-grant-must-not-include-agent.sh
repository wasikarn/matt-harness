# this fleet spawns further subagents — Rule 13 (CLAUDE.md's Staff-Engineer Thinking Loop section) is
# "a dispatched sub-agent must not re-orchestrate." Check 09 already CRITs an agent missing
# tools: entirely (door 1: silent full-tool inheritance, including Agent). This check closes
# door 2: an explicit tools: grant that names Agent. WARN, not CRIT — a bad explicit grant is
# authored and reviewed before it ships (unlike door 1's silent inheritance), so it's
# recoverable by construction. Shares check 24's strip_tool_token() helper (in
# scripts/_lib/frontmatter-helpers.sh) so `Agent(...)` or JSON-array syntax still matches.
