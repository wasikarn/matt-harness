# 37. Dead script-pointer doc-rot (skill/command/agent bodies invoke a script that does not exist)
# Matt "beware doc-rot": a surface body that tells the model to run
# `bash .../scripts/NAME.sh` (or a `python3 .../NAME.py` invocation) for a file
# that exists nowhere in the fleet is an instruct-the-model-to-run-a-missing-
# script defect — it crashes on invoke. The matt-first cut (242->87) deleted
# surfaces but left such pointers dangling; this guard is the regression fence.
#
# Scope: only EXECUTABLE invocations — a line that runs the script via `bash`,
# `sh`, `python3`, `python`, `node`, or `exec`. Descriptive prose that NAMES a
# script to say it is absent/retired (e.g. "its backing scripts/x.sh is absent")
# is deliberately not matched: the match requires an interpreter token before
# the path. WARN, not CRIT — advisory, matching the operating model (sensors
# journal; the CRIT set is reserved for the irrecoverable/tamper class).
