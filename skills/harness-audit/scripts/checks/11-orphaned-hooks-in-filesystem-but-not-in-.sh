# 11. Orphaned hooks (in filesystem but not in settings.json)
# NOTE: this used to be wrapped in `if [ -f "$SETTINGS" ]; then ... fi`, which
# silently skipped the ENTIRE check body whenever settings.json doesn't exist
# -- true for matt-harness's own flat plugin-mode layout (this repo carries no
# settings.json at all). That meant check 11 never actually ran in real
# pre-commit/pre-push here, independent of any wiring-match precision issue.
# Found 2026-08-19 during a deep-audit falsification test. Fixed by dropping
# the file-existence gate: the per-hook `grep -q "$hook_name" "$SETTINGS"`
# below already degrades correctly to "not found" when $SETTINGS is absent
# (same pattern check 03 already relies on), so plugin-mode hooks still
# correctly skip via the hooks.json/transitive branches.
