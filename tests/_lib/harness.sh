# harness.sh — shared test scaffolding for tests/hooks/test-fragments-{arm,
# capture,surface}.sh (originally 5 consumers including the now-removed
# tests/hooks/test-handoff-{nudge,surface}.sh, see git history): the
# fresh_tmpdir/fresh_repo/_cleanup_trash trio that used to be 5 separate
# copies, 3 of which were missing the empty-string guard the other 2 had --
# the exact bug that moved this repo's working tree to Trash mid-session
# (trash "" deletes the process's cwd). One definition so that guard can't
# be present in some copies and missing in others again.
#
# Not matched by any of scripts/run-gauntlet.sh's five test-discovery globs
# (tests/hooks/*.sh, tests/skills/test*.sh, tests/skills/*/test*.sh,
# tests/scripts/test*.sh, tests/evals/test*.sh) -- this lives under
# tests/_lib/, so it is linted (git ls-files '*.sh') but never executed as
# a test itself. Source it, don't execute it.
#
# Caller contract: this file declares EXTRA_TRASH and the functions below;
# it never registers the EXIT trap itself, so each caller still does its
# own `trap _cleanup_trash EXIT` after sourcing.

# _HARNESS_ROOT: one real tmpdir created here, at source time, in the
# caller's own shell -- not inside a function invoked via $(...) (deep-audit
# finding, live-reproduced: every caller uses `T=$(fresh_tmpdir)`, and a
# function's ENTIRE body runs in a forked subshell when called that way, so
# an EXTRA_TRASH+=(...) done from inside fresh_tmpdir never reached the
# parent's array -- `${#EXTRA_TRASH[@]}` stayed 0 after every such call,
# meaning fresh_tmpdir's output was never actually cleaned up). fresh_tmpdir
# below now mktemps a subdir of this already-live root instead of
# registering itself into an array, so no subshell-scoped mutation is
# needed for the common case at all.

# inside a function invoked via $(...), or it inherits the same bug.
