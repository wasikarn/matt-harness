# test-harness-audit.sh: self-test for harness-audit (maker-grades-own-work guard).
#
# audit.sh's fragment integrity guard catches LOST checks, not SILENT ones. Each
# known-bad fixture below is paired with a clean one; the matching check must
# FIRE on bad and stay SILENT on good. Per-check fixtures cover 04, 05, 20, 22, 28, 29, 54,
# 70, 71, 72, 73, 74 (five fixtures, two added 2026-09-21), 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81; the fleet-bad / fleet-good pair covers every other check with at
# least one defect per check (43 is driven by the env ceiling, not a planted defect).
# check-73-bad-missing-command-field and check-73-bad-args-fingerprint-mismatch (below) are
# deep-audit fixes, 2026-09-10: a Codex-primary fresh-context checker found the original check
# 73 silently passed a handler missing its "command" field, and never compared the "args" field
# (a real, documented command-hook field, exec form) -- both independently reproduced before fix.
