# test-gauntlet-validate-benign.sh — regression: Claude Code 2.1.289's strict plugin validate
# warns "CLAUDE.md at the plugin root is not loaded as project context" and --strict turns it
# into an error, so every pre-push failed (CI pins 2.1.287 and stayed green). That one warning
# is intentional here (docs/METHODOLOGY.md ships via hooks). run_validate() must accept a strict
# failure whose only warning is that line, and fail on anything else. A stub `claude` on PATH
# plays each scenario; the real CLI is never run.
