# Behavioral tests for hooks/gates/_journal.py, restored 2026-09-12 after commit
# 2cac98c8 deleted the central-dispatcher version with no replacement. Covers:
# a deny verdict journals a row, an allow-only payload adds none (volume
# control), the fail-safe (an unwritable journal path must never change the
# gate's own exit code/stdout, using an ENOTDIR fixture that is uid-independent
# -- a chmod-based fixture is a no-op as root, which this repo's own podman
# ubuntu:24.04 dry-run lane runs as), and a gate-id drift guard (each gate's
# hardcoded GATE_ID constant must actually exist in hooks/hook-registry.json).
# Run standalone: bash tests/hooks/test-gate-journal.sh
set -uo pipefail

# This file tests the HOME-fallback path directly (cases 1-4) and the
# override explicitly (case 5) -- unset any ambient MH_GATE_JOURNAL_PATH
# first, since scripts/run-gauntlet.sh's hook-test layer sets one for the
# whole suite and it would otherwise silently win over every HOME= prefix
# below, making cases 1-4 write nowhere the assertions look.
