# classifier (assertion removed -> ask, skip marker added -> ask, an added
# always-false conditional/loop wrap around a kept assertion -> ask across
# its if/elif/while and bracket/bare-test spellings), the path narrowing to
# real test-root shapes (not a bare "test"/"spec" substring), and the
# negative controls the adversarial plan review demanded: new-file test
# creation, an edit that only adds an assertion, a non-test path that merely
# contains "test"/"spec" as a substring, and the always-TRUE `[ 0 ]`/
# `[[ false ]]` single-operand tests (must all stay silent). Also proves a
# documented gap stays a documented gap (moving an assertion into an
# uncalled function evades the diff by design, not by accident).
