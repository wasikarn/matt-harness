"""Deterministic weighted scorer for mh:deep-audit and mh:idea-audit.

stdin:  {"scores": [{"id": str, "score": num, "max": num, "weight": num,
                      "insufficient": bool}, ...],
         "floorPct": 0-1, "passThreshold": num | omitted, "primaryId": str | omitted,
         "perturb": 0<p<1 | omitted}
stdout: {"total": float, "weightSum": float, "belowFloor": [id...],
         "pass": bool | null, "primaryWeightOk": bool | null,
         "sensitivity": {"perturb": num, "totalRange": [lo, hi],
                          "verdictStable": bool | null} | omitted}

An optional `perturb` runs a weight-sensitivity check: every SCORED weight is
independently moved +/-perturb (renormalized -- see _sensitivity's docstring
for why this is exact, not sampled) and the resulting min/max `total` is
reported as `totalRange`. `verdictStable` says whether `pass` can change
anywhere in that box; it is `null` when no `passThreshold` was given (ranges
alone are still meaningful, e.g. for mh:idea-audit).

Known limitation, found by mh:deep-audit 2026-09-20: `primaryWeightOk` is
computed once, from the original unperturbed weights; `sensitivity`'s corners
do not check whether a perturbation could make the primary axis stop being
the single largest weight. No current caller passes both `primaryId` and
`perturb` in the same call (mh:idea-audit, the only `primaryId` user, does
not opt into `perturb` for v1) -- if one ever does, `primaryWeightOk: true`
would not guarantee the invariant holds at every reported corner.

The model scores each dimension and writes reasons; this script does the
arithmetic (weighted total, floor check, pass/fail) so a wrong hand sum or a
hand-renormalized total can never reach a Final Verdict. Mirrors
skills/workflow/ideate/scripts/rank.py's contract and --selftest convention.

An `insufficient`-flagged item is dropped from both the numerator and the
denominator, so `total` renormalizes over the weights that actually scored
-- never divides by the full declared weight sum, which would be
arithmetically identical to scoring the dropped item 0.

Fails closed: any input this script cannot compute (a non-object payload, a
missing/non-numeric field, a bool or non-finite score/max/weight, a non-bool
`insufficient` -- the string "false" is truthy, a non-positive max or negative
weight, a duplicate id, every item flagged insufficient, or the `primaryId`
item itself flagged insufficient) exits 1 with a one-line reason on stderr
and prints no JSON. The last case matters because `insufficient` items are
dropped from the total's numerator/denominator (see below) with no separate
signal -- for an ordinary axis that's a fair renormalization, but for the
axis a caller declared `primaryId` (the one that "can't be diluted to
parity" per mh:idea-audit's own Rule 14 rationale) it would silently produce
a complete-looking total with the single most load-bearing axis missing.
Found by mh:deep-audit 2026-09-19: idea-audit's own SKILL.md deliberately
omits `passThreshold` for this phase ("a scored verdict... not a single
pass/fail gate"), so nothing downstream was catching this case either.
The caller must treat that as a hard fail, never as license to score by hand.

    +/-perturb, holding the original `weight_sum` fixed as the external
    multiplier (never recomputed from the perturbed vector).

    Only relative weight among the SCORED items can move `total` -- weight_sum
    is a fixed scaling constant here, not something perturbation redistributes,
    so `total`'s new value is exactly (sum of r_i*w_i') / (sum of w_i') *
    weight_sum for the perturbed scored weights w_i'. An `insufficient` item's
    weight never enters that ratio, so perturbing it is a provable no-op, not
    an approximation -- it is excluded from both the corner enumeration and
    the axis-count cap below. A weight-0 item is the same no-op for the same
    reason (0 * any factor is still 0) and is excluded alongside it -- found
    by mh:deep-audit 2026-09-20: without this, a placeholder weight-0 axis
    could push an otherwise-fine score over MAX_PERTURB_AXES and fail closed.

    Corners, not a random search: for fixed weight_sum, `total` as a function
    of the scored weights is a ratio of two functions linear in those weights
    (linear-fractional, hence quasilinear), so its extrema over the +/-perturb
    box are exactly at the box's 2**n vertices -- deterministic, no PRNG, same
    "deterministic script" contract rank.py/plan-verdict-check.py already hold.
