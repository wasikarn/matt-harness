"""Structural self-consistency check for agents/plan-reviewer.md's fatal-weakness-floor gate.

Found by mh:deep-audit 2026-09-19: plan-reviewer is the one adversarial surface in this repo
with no schema and no script -- Critical/High/Medium/Low severity and the resulting verdict are
both model-assigned in prose, with the exact self-contradiction the agent's own Anti-Patterns
list names ("verdict: production-ready alongside a non-empty top_blockers list") caught only if
the same model that made the mistake also happens to notice it.

This does NOT re-review the plan or second-guess a severity assignment -- that's a judgment
call, not this script's job. It only checks that `verdict` and `top_blockers_count` are the
values `findings` mechanically implies, per plan-reviewer.md's own severity rule:
  production-ready: zero findings of any severity
  ready-with-caveats: only Medium/Low findings remain
  needs-revision: at least one Critical or High finding
`not-ready` is deliberately NOT checked against `findings` here -- per plan-reviewer.md, it's a
different question ("can this plan even be evaluated") that needs judgment about whether the
plan names a target at all, not a function of severity counts.

stdin: {"findings": [{"severity": "Critical"|"High"|"Medium"|"Low"}, ...],
        "top_blockers_count": int, "verdict": "production-ready"|"ready-with-caveats"|
        "needs-revision"|"not-ready"}

`findings` here is the FULL list from plan-reviewer's `findings:` field, not the (possibly
truncated) `top_blockers:` display list -- plan-reviewer.md caps `top_blockers` at 10 entries for
readability, but `top_blockers_count` must be the full, uncapped Critical+High tally from
`findings`. Found by mh:deep-audit 2026-09-19: a caller computing `top_blockers_count` from
`len(top_blockers)` on a plan with more than 10 Critical/High findings would get a mechanically
correct review rejected here for a display artifact, not a real inconsistency.

Exit 0: consistent (or `not-ready`, not checked against findings) -- nothing on stdout.
Exit 1: verdict doesn't match what `findings` implies, or `top_blockers_count` doesn't equal
the Critical+High count -- reason on stderr.
