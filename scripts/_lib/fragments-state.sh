# git repo root -- identical derivation to codex-state-path.sh, so two
# different repos never collide. (The now-removed mh:handoff skill's
# handoff-path.sh used the same derivation too; see git history.)

# pointer-capture.md, round-1 finding) -- every directory in the chain is
# checked, not just the base. That defense (hook_safe_dir/hook_owner_ok)
# lives in scripts/_lib/hook-common.sh.
