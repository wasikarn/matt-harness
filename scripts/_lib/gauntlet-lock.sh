# gauntlet-lock.sh — a per-user queue so only one pre-push gauntlet runs at a time (GH #158).
# The gauntlet's timing rows (finishes inside 4 s / 8 s) fail when several gauntlets, or a gauntlet
# and busy peer sessions, share the machine; waiting for your turn is deterministic where waiting
# for the load to drop is a guess. Source it, then:
#   gauntlet_lock_acquire; trap gauntlet_lock_release EXIT
# The lock is a directory taken with an atomic mkdir, holding the owner's pid. Waiters poll with
# jitter so peers do not all start the moment it frees. A lock whose owner is gone, or that is older
# than GAUNTLET_LOCK_MAX_AGE (pid reuse), is reclaimed by one waiter at a time: it takes a claim dir
# (<lock>.reclaim, atomic mkdir), re-checks that the lock is still stale under the claim, then
# removes it, so no waiter can remove a lock another waiter has just taken. A child of the holder (a
# test that runs the pre-push hook) sees MH_GAUNTLET_LOCK_OWNER and skips the queue, so it cannot
# deadlock the gauntlet that runs it.
# Fail open, and never fail the caller: a wait past GAUNTLET_LOCK_WAIT_SECS, or a lock dir that
# cannot be created, prints a message and runs without the lock. Every command here is guarded, so
# a caller under `set -e` (the pre-push hook) is never aborted by it. This only orders work; it is
# never a gate. Known edge: a pid reused by an unrelated long-lived process keeps a dead owner's
# lock "alive" until GAUNTLET_LOCK_MAX_AGE, so pushes in that hour wait out the cap, then run.
# Env: GAUNTLET_LOCK_DIR (default $HOME/.cache/mh/gauntlet.lock), GAUNTLET_LOCK_WAIT_SECS (1800),
# GAUNTLET_LOCK_POLL (5, seconds, stretched by 0-50% jitter), GAUNTLET_LOCK_MAX_AGE (3600),
# GAUNTLET_LOCK_NOPID_SECS (60: how old a pid-less lock dir must be to count as a crash leftover).
# Bash 3.2.
